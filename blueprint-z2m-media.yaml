  name: "Zigbee2MQTT - MOES Smart Knob Media Player Control"
  description: >
    **Version 2.0.0** - Optimized for Arcam AV40 (200ms command throttle)


    Control a media player with a MOES Smart Knob (ERS-10TZBVK-AA) via Zigbee2MQTT.


    **Requires an input_number helper** to track target volume. Create one at
    Settings → Helpers → Number (min: 0, max: 1, step: 0.01).


    **The knob must be in EVENT mode** (triple-click to switch modes).


    - **Rotate right/left**: Volume up/down (all rotations counted, debounced)

    - **Single press**: Run configurable action (e.g., home cinema ON)

    - **Double press**: Run configurable action (e.g., home cinema OFF)

    - **Hold (3s)**: Sync volume helper from device (use if out of sync)


    This blueprint debounces rapid rotations and sends a single volume command
    after 200ms of no rotation. This matches the Arcam integration's throttle
    for optimal responsiveness.
